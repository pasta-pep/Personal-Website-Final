      <p>BIO</p> 
      <p>Hi all, 

       Joseph here, a beginner coder who is eager to explore the world of programming. Despite being new to the coding 
       scene, I am excited for learning and acquiring new skills. When I'm not learning how to code, I like to indulge in going 
       out to restaurants, I enjoy visiting various restaurants, from Italian, Spanish, New American, and Thia, they all have a 
       special place in my heart. However, I have genuine commitment to personal growth, I'm dedicated to becoming a better version 
       of myself, constantly seeking ways to enhance who I am. Through my coding journey and personal development endeavors, I am 
       determined, and a well-rounded individual.</p>
